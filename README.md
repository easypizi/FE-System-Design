# Front-End System Design Playbook (React + Vite)

This repository is a hands-on playbook to learn and practice front-end system design. It focuses on React with Vite for client-side development and references SSR options where appropriate. Code snippets are illustrative and may not be runnable out of the box.

## What you will find
- A lightweight framework for structuring system design answers: RADIO+ (Requirements → API/Data → Interface → Operations → Risks/Trade-offs → Observability/Testing → Checklists)
- Modular guides with diagrams, decision trees, and checklists
- Self-contained examples in TypeScript/TSX or pseudocode
- Case studies (news feed, chat, e-commerce) showing end-to-end choices

## Start here
- Read the RADIO+ framework: `docs/RADIO.md`
- Browse the topic guides: `systems/`
- Explore component patterns: `components/`
- See end-to-end case studies: `case-studies/`
- Showcase/Docs: `docs/` (can be served with GitHub Pages)

## Topics overview
- Rendering models (CSR/SSR/SSG/ISR/Streaming)
- Data fetching (REST/GraphQL, pagination, typeahead, realtime)
- Caching & Offline (HTTP caching, Service Worker, SWR)
- Performance (Core Web Vitals, code-splitting, images/fonts)
- Accessibility & i18n
- Security & Auth (OAuth/OIDC/PKCE, CSRF/XSS/CSP)
- Observability (logs, metrics, traces, RUM, feature flags)
- Error handling & reliability (retry/backoff, circuit breaker)
- Design system & UI components
- Testing & CI/CD
