# Global rules for this repository (Cursor)

## Language & Style
- All prose and code comments must be in English.
- Prefer TypeScript for examples; keep snippets self-contained and readable.
- Use `const` for functions and handlers (e.g., `const handleClick = () => {}`).
- Favor early returns and clear guard clauses.
- Accessibility first: include `role`, `aria-*`, `tabIndex`, and `onKeyDown` where relevant.
- If JSX is used, style exclusively with Tailwind CSS utility classes.

## Structure
- Organize content under `systems/`, `components/`, and `case-studies/`.
- Keep examples in `examples/` subfolders near their guides.
- Use checklists and decision tables for trade-offs.
- Include Mermaid diagrams for key flows and decision trees.

## Framework
- Follow RADIO+ in guides: Requirements → API/Data → Interface → Operations → Risks/Trade-offs → Observability/Testing → Checklists.

## Quality
- Avoid TODOs; provide minimal but complete examples.
- Keep files small and focused; link out to related sections.
- Prefer framework-agnostic explanations; add React/Vite/SSR notes where needed.
